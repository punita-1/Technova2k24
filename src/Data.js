In Round 1, participants will unleash their paper-folding skills as they craft aerodynamic paper airplanes designed to soar through the air with speed and accuracy. Throughout both rounds, participants will demonstrate their creativity, technical skills, and problem-solving abilities as they strive for precision and accuracy in both the physical and digital realms. Judges will evaluate the paper airplanes based on flight distance, accuracy, and aerodynamic performance, while digital designs will be assessed for accuracy, innovation, and adherence to design specifications.",

    "<li>Aeronautic Aviators Contest: Participants will fold and craft paper airplanes before testing their designs in a series of distance and accuracy challenges. Points will be awarded based on the distance flown and the ability to hit designated targets.</li>"+
    "<li>Here are the rules for the Aeronautic Aviators Contest:</li>"+
    "<li>1.Time: 15 minutes.</li>"+
    "<li>2.Materials: Each team will be provided with a standard set of materials for constructing paper airplanes. This may include paper (of a specific size or weight), scissors, and tape. </li>"+
    "<li>3.Design Phase: Teams have a designated amount of time to design and construct their paper airplanes using the provided materials. The design should incorporate principles of aerodynamics to achieve maximum distance and accuracy.</li>"+
    "<li>4.Launcher Specifications: Paper airplanes must be hand-launched by team members from a designated starting point. The airplanes should be capable of sustained flight and must be powered solely by human force.</li>"+
    "<li>5.Scoring: Points are awarded based on the distance achieved by the paper airplane. The airplane that travels the farthest distance from the starting point earns the team the highest score. </li>"+

    "<li>Round 2:</li>"+
    "<li>In this round, participants will take their creativity to the digital realm as they bring their paper aero paper designs to life using AutoCAD, the leading software for computer-aided design (CAD).</li>"+
    "<li>Participants will have the opportunity to translate their handcrafted aero-paper designs into precise digital models using AutoCAD's powerful tools and features. From intricate wing designs to streamlined fuselages, participants will meticulously recreate every detail of their paper aero papers with precision and accuracy.</li>"+
    "<li>Rules:</li>"+
    "<li>1.The teams will be given 30 minutes for the design.</li>"+
    "<li>2.Taking outside help is prohibited.</li>"+
